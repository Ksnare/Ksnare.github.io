During the third week, there were KUB Teenwork tours and we spent the first two days of our week with each other and it was refreshing to get back into an environment where there wasn't a big age gap and we knew each other well. Also it took away from the focus of our confined workspaces and allowed us to again see the larger picture of KUB as whole. The next day was the first annual Creekside Cookout and It brought out most of the KUB work force from all the departments which really painted a picture of community for the company and that week was really fun because it showed me how good this company is at being a community.
