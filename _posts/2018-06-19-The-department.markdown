The second week of the program was the monthly department meeting and against me predating judgment the meeting was actually quite nice. Everyone in the meeting understood what they were there for and the also understood that the meeting could be the most uninteresting thing on earth so they did a lot to brighten up the atmosphere
and it showed how conscious they were of each other and the `family` dynamic of the department.
