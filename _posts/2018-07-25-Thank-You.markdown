I spent my summer working in the ISD department of KUB at the Miller's Building Downtown. The experience was actually quite refreshing. It's great to see a group of people who can work together and enjoy each others company and accomplish great things together. I know I am most definitely going to miss the random and sometimes surprisingly surprising conversations. I am going to miss making them all laugh and them doing the same for me. This summer was great and it's just a bonus that I got paid for it. Thanks Department 22 for all the guidance and bearing my horrible typing. You guys are my favorite department.


Thank You
