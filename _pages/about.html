My name is Kellen Brabson, a Rising Senior at Austin East Magnet highschool, and I am apart of the KUB Teenworkers Program Austin-East Magent highschool Juniors. Through this program I have been able to work with the informational service department of the Knoxville Utilities Board.
This website will be a blog documenting my time here. Thanks for coming.
