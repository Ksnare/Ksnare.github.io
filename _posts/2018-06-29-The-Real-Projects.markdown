The fourth week was the first time I was given real KUB projects that would affect the KUB Apps Website.
The first thing I was told to dig into a patch of code and pull out a small piece of script and change it To fix a small error.
It sounds like more than what it is and despite the fact that I finished the work quite quickly it was still very challenging.
